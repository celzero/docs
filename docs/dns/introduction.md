Rethink**DNS** is [DNS Resolver](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/) Service with custom rules and blocklists. A DNS resolver is an address book of the internet-- it helps locate IP addresses of the servers given a domain name. For example, dns.google.com (a domain name) is located at 8.8.8.8 (IP address). This mapping is retrieved by a DNS resolver.

You can configure Rethink**DNS** in the companion [firewall app](firewall) or even in your own device / internet browser that supports [Secure DNS](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS) (aka DNS over HTTPS). See below on [how to configure](#how-to).

RethinkDNS is private, secure, and fast DNS resolver and has 190+ pre-defined blacklists for you to configure.

With our paid plans (coming soon), you'll also be able to define your own custom blocklists that can be configured with Rethink**DNS**. The paid plan will also allow you to store you dns logs and view analytics, all in the cloud. You will be able to analyse your DNS requests and read through aggregated reports.

RethinkDNS is highly-available with servers in over 200+ locations across the globe for fast DNS resolution.

## How To Configure DNS {#how-to}

A custom DNS resolver can be configured here: [rethinkdns.com/configure](https://www.rethinkdns.com/configure). This will give a DNS resolver address that looks something like `https://basic.bravedns.com/1:YASAAQBwIAA=` according to blocklists or rules that you selected. This address can then be used as your DNS resolver in your device or browser. If you already have a DNS link and you want to reconfigure, just paste the link in the search bar of the configue page, and you're good to go.
