The free and open source RethinkDNS Resolver is serverless and supports protocols: DNS over HTTPS (DoH) & DNS over TLS (DoT). It can be configured with custom blocklists. And can be hosted on cloudflare, fly.io or deno-deploy. Source code is made available at [github.com/serverless-dns/serverless-dns](https://github.com/serverless-dns/serverless-dns).

## Hosting your own DNS Resolver {#hosting}

This serverless DNS can be hosted to three platforms: Cloudflare, Deno-Deploy and Fly.io. Easiest way would be to use Cloudflare. The below table summarizes the platforms available.

| Platform      | Difficulty | Resolver Protocol | Instructions                      |
| ------------- | ---------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
| â›… Cloudflare  | Easy       | DoH             | [Read Instructions](#cloudflare)  |
| ðŸ¦• Deno Deploy | Moderate   | DoH             | [Read Instructions](#deno-deploy) |
| ðŸª‚ Fly.io         | Hard       | DoH and DoT       | [Read Instructions](#fly-io)      |

### Using Cloudflare {#cloudflare}

Rethink serverless can be hosted to cloudflare. User will be liable for cloudflare billing. Click the button below to deploy.

[![Deploy to Cloudflare Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/serverless-dns/serverless-dns/)

- Configure
	- Once the hosting is successful, lets consider rethink serverless dns is hosted
		to `example.com`.
	- To configure your dns level blocking visit to `example.com/configure` which
		will take to configuration page, which currently contains 191 blocklists with
		~13.5 Million blockable domains in category like notracking, dating, gambling,
		privacy, porn, cryptojacking, security ...
	- Navigate through and select your blocklists.
	- Once selected you can find your domain name `example.com` followed by
		configuration token on screen like this `https://example.com/1:AIAA7g==` copy
		it and add to your dns DOH client.
	- Now your own trusted dns resolver with custom blocking is up and running.


- Change Resolver
	- By default dns request are resolved by cloudflare `cloudflare-dns.com`.
	- To change resolver login to your cloudflare dash board
		- click on `worker`
		- click on `serverless-dns` worker
		- click on `Settings` tab
		- under `Environment Variables` click on `Edit variables`
		- if your new DOH resolver url is `example.dns.resolver.com/dns-query/resolve`
		- change below variables and click on save button
			`CF_DNS_RESOLVER_URL = example.dns.resolver.com/dns-query/resolve`
       - alternatively, you can modify your `CF_DNS_RESOLVER_URL` in your forked serverless-dns repo. Head to src/core/env.js and modify either your `CF_DNS_RESOLVER_URL` or `CF_DNS_RESOLVER_URL_2` DNS server



### Using Deno-Deploy {#deno-deploy}

This project can be hosted on [deno.com/deploy](https://deno.com/deploy) and supports DoH only. User will be liable for deno.com billing.

1. Fork the [serverless-dns repository](https://github.com/serverless-dns/serverless-dns) (requries a GitHub account).
2. Now, navigate to [deno.com/deploy](https://deno.com/deploy) and _Sign Up_ for an account.
3. Create a new project via the [deno dashboard](https://dash.deno.com). Name the project as you wish.
4. Click on the _Continue_ button under _Deploy from GitHub_ and proceed to install the GitHub app to your GitHub Account. This is important: From your GitHub acction, make sure to give _deno.com_ requisite permission to access your fork (created in _Step 1_).
5. Now, head back the deno.com dashboard and select your fork to which you just opened up access to. Type in `main` as the _production branch_, and choose _GitHub Action_ as the _deployment mode_.
6. From the dashboard again, for this project, navigate to Settings -> Environment variables (`https://dash.deno.com/projects/<project-name>/settings/envs`). Set environment variables as appropriate for your use-case (refer [`.env.example`](https://github.com/serverless-dns/serverless-dns/blob/main/.env.example) file as `key = "value"` pairs, example key/value env in [`wrangler.toml`](https://github.com/serverless-dns/serverless-dns/blob/main/wrangler.toml) and/or [`fly.toml`](https://github.com/serverless-dns/serverless-dns/blob/main/fly.toml) files).
7. Back on GitHub, from your forked repository, click on the _Actions_ tab and _Confirm_ that you want to use _Actions_, if prompted.
8. On GitHub, navigate to the repository's _Settings_ (top nav), and tap on _Secrets_ (left nav). Click the _New repository secret_ button, and fill-in _Name_ with `DENO_PROJECT_NAME` and _Value_ with the name of your deno.com project as set in _Step 3_.
9. Select "ðŸ¦• Deno" from left-nav. Then, click on the "Run workflow" dropdown that appears on the top-right corner. Tap _Run_ to run it with preset defaults.
10. If the workflow run succeeds, the RethinkDNS DoH resolver should be up and running on `https://<name>.deno.dev`, where `<name>` is the name of the project as set in _Step 3_. If not, [reach out to us over on GitHub](https://github.com/serverless-dns/serverless-dns/discussions).

### Using Fly.io {#fly-io}

This project can be hosted on [fly.io](https://fly.io), and can support both DoT and DoH protocols. User will be liable for fly.io billing.

1. Install `flyctl` on your device ([ref](https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/installing-flyctl/)).
2. Signup and/or login to fly.io ([ref](https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/login-to-fly/)).
3. Create an empty directory anywhere on your PC. Open you terminal or powershell and navigate to this directory.
4. Launch a fly app
	```bash
	flyctl launch
	```
	- Choose a unique name here or let it auto-generate.
	- Choose a location (the closer to your users, the better).
	- Note down the name of the app and you may delete this directory along with the generated `fly.toml`.
5. Now, you would need a SSL or TLS certificate for your domain name. Both getting a domain name and CA certificate generation are beyond the scope of this README. [_Let's Encrypt_](https://certbot.eff.org/) and [_ZeroSSL_](https://www.frankindev.com/2021/10/14/free-wildcard-ssl-by-zerossl-with-acme.sh/) vend public certs for free, valid for a maximum of 90 days.
6. Once you have your CA certificate and key files, you need to encode them as base64 with no wrapping. How this can be done in bash terminal is shown below.
	```bash
	# Locate your CA certificate & key files
	CRT="path/to/full-chain-certificate.pem"
	KEY="path/to/key.pem"
	```
	```bash
	# Encode them in base64 with no wrappings and store them in variables
	B64NOWRAP_KEY="$(base64 -w0 "$KEY")"
	B64NOWRAP_CRT="$(base64 -w0 "$CRT")"
	```
7. As described in [`.env.example`](https://github.com/serverless-dns/serverless-dns/blob/main/.env.example) file, this base64 encoded certificate-key pair need to set as a single environment variable called `TLS_`. Within this variable, the certificate and key encodings needs to be separated by a newline (`\n`) and described by `CRT=` and `KEY=`. On a bash terminal this can be done by following steps continued by by above.
	```bash
	# This creates a single file called "FLY_TLS" in the current directory
	echo "KEY=$B64NOWRAP_KEY" > FLY_TLS
	echo "CRT=$B64NOWRAP_CRT" >> FLY_TLS
	# And now, this "FLY_TLS" file contains both certificate and key encoded and
	# as required
	```
	- Upload this to fly secrets like so in terminal or powershell:
		```bash
		fly secrets set TLS_CERTKEY=- < FLY_TLS -a <app-id>
		```
		where `<app-id>` is the name of the fly app you had launched in step 4.
	- Other essential environment variables are already present in [`fly.toml`](https://github.com/serverless-dns/serverless-dns/blob/main/fly.toml) file of this repository, but you may read [`.env.example`](https://github.com/serverless-dns/serverless-dns/blob/main/.env.example) for it's use case and configuration.
8. Fork the [serverless-dns repository](https://github.com/serverless-dns/serverless-dns) (you will need a GitHub account).
9. In your fork, click on the _Actions_ tab and Confirm that you want to use Actions, if asked.
10. Similarly, click on _Settings_ tab and select _Secrets_ on the left pane. Add a new GitHub secret called **FLY_APP_NAME** and set it's value as the name of the fly app you had launched in step 4. And add another secret called **FLY_API_TOKEN** and set's value as what you get from running `flyctl auth token` in terminal or powershell.
11. Head back to _Actions_ tab and click on _Fly_ on the left pane. Click on the _Run workflow_ dropdown on the right side, and run the workflow using the <kbd>Run workflow</kbd> button.
12. Once this action workflow finishes, open the terminal or powershell again and type in:
	```bash
	flyctl ips list -a <app-id>
	```
	where `<app-id>` is the name of the fly app you had launched in step 4.
	- Here, you can get the IP address of the application, update the DNS records of your domain name you had used in step 5.
13. Done. Your application should be available on the said domain name in a few minutes. To configure, for example, the upstream resolver, you can edit the environment variables in the `fly.toml` file of your fork and re-run the Action workflow.
